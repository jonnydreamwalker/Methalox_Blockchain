# MethaloxChain Node Deployment Guide

This guide will help you set up and run a MethaloxChain validator node. The process is straightforward and works on Ubuntu Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04).

**Estimated Cost on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:
- Free tier instances (Ampere A1) are often out of stock.
- A reliable small instance (VM.Standard.E5.Flex, 1 OCPU, 12 GB RAM) costs **approximately $2–$15 per month** depending on usage and credits.
- You can run multiple nodes for $10–$50/month total.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create an Ubuntu Instance (Example: Oracle Cloud)

1. Log in to the OCI Console: https://cloud.oracle.com
2. Go to **Compute** > **Instances** > **Create instance**.
3. Name: e.g., `Methalox_Node_1`
4. Image: Canonical Ubuntu 22.04
5. Shape: VM.Standard.E5.Flex (or Ampere A1 if available)
   - OCPU: 1
   - Memory: 12 GB
6. Networking: Use your existing VCN and public subnet (same as your primary node for easy sync).
7. SSH keys: Paste your public SSH key.
8. Create the instance.
9. Note the **Public IP address**.

### 2. SSH into Your New Instance

From your local computer (Mac/Windows/Linux):
```bash
ssh ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP

The deployment instructions in this guide use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as an example provider due to its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with MethaloxChain node requirements. This is provided solely for illustrative purposes to demonstrate a typical setup process.
MethaloxChain nodes can be deployed on any compatible Linux-based server (cloud provider or dedicated hardware) that meets the system requirements and does not prohibit blockchain node operation in its terms of service.
Users are responsible for reviewing the provider's acceptable use policy to ensure compliance, as some providers restrict blockchain-related activities.
This flexibility supports broad accessibility and decentralization of the MethaloxChain network.
