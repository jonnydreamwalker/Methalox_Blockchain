# MethaloxChain Node Deployment Guide

This guide will help you set up and run a MethaloxChain validator node. The process is straightforward and works on Ubuntu Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04).

**Estimated Cost on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:
- Free tier instances (Ampere A1) are often out of stock.
- A reliable small instance (VM.Standard.E5.Flex, 1 OCPU, 12 GB RAM) costs **approximately $2–$15 per month** depending on usage and credits.
- You can run multiple nodes for $10–$50/month total.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create an Ubuntu Instance (Example: Oracle Cloud)

1. Log in to the OCI Console: https://cloud.oracle.com
2. Go to **Compute** > **Instances** > **Create instance**.
3. Name: e.g., `Methalox_Node_1`
4. Image: Canonical Ubuntu 22.04
5. Shape: VM.Standard.E5.Flex (or Ampere A1 if available)
   - OCPU: 1
   - Memory: 12 GB
6. Networking: Use your existing VCN and public subnet (same as your primary node for easy sync).
7. SSH keys: Paste your public SSH key.
8. Create the instance.
9. Note the **Public IP address**.

### 2. SSH into Your New Instance

From your local computer (Mac/Windows/Linux):
```bash
ssh ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
